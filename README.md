# Geode-Mod-Transfer
A mod concept which will be later be turned to an actual mod, for Geode to support transfer of mods, and their configurations, as well as texture packs, and etc.

To basically understand, Geode when installed, makes a "mods" folder and a "config" folder. By taking copying these folders and transfering, this is made possible.
